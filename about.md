## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Gustav Andersson. I study web development at Linneuniversitet in Sweden, located in Växjö and Kalmar, however I live in Stockholm and study remotely.
I'm a bit of a tech geek and I enjoy creating stuff for the web, but I am also interested in Linux, server side programming, hardware and electronics in general. And although I am still a novice in these fields, I enjoy tinkering with them at home, at my own leisure.

### Other projects
<div class="box">
  <p>
  My first project, created about a year ago, is <a href="http://gstav.se" target="blank">this website</a>. It is very incomplete, and only serves as a playground for me to try new techniques. It was created using the framework AngularJS, so it is effectively a single page application. Feel free to browse.
