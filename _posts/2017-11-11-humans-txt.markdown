humans.txt is a textfile you can put in the root directory of your site. It is a .txt file that contains information about the creators of the website in question. It was invented as a fast and easy way to give credit to the authors without interfering with the code. 

The humans.txt follows a standard of some sort, and so under the heading _TEAM_, you put information about the humans involved in the making of the site, and under _SITE_, you can put information about how the site was built, with what frameworks and libraries, etc. However, since the file is solely intended for humans to read, you could structure it however you like. 

If you include your e-mail, you could subject yourself to spam, therefore I do not recommend it.

My humans.txt:
