I think Static Site Generators are a great way of getting started. I have a made a website from scratch a couple of times, and it is always a bit of a pain to get started. The header and navbar are usually not the most exciting elements to develop, yet they need to be done and also made responsive. 

SSGs can definitely reduce the hump you need to get over to start a new project. Iâ€™m a fan of css libraries such as Bootstrap as well. Granted, they are limited, but if you want to quickly set up a site and then concentrate on creating cool functionality or whatever you wanna do, then SSGs might be for you.
