I think Static Site Generators are a great way of getting a project started. I have a made a website from scratch a couple of times, and it is always a bit of a pain to get started.

You need to write a fair share of css just to get your site to look reasonably well designed, and to top it off, you need to make it all responsive. Nowadays, it is not enough catering to the desktop users. You need to make sure your site looks good on mobiles and tablets, too!

SSGs can help you with this. They can significantly reduce the hump you need to get over to start a new project. Iâ€™m myself a fan of such css libraries as Bootstrap, too. Granted, they are limited, and require you to learn some new syntax, but if you want to quickly set up a site that just works, then concentrate on creating developing your blog or whatever you wanna do, then SSGs might be for you.

Jekyll has great support for blogs, out of the box, and it supports both markdown and html. Jekyll is also the engine behind Github Pages, making it a breeze hosting your jekyll site on their servers. Oh, and did I mention it's free to host on Github Pages?
